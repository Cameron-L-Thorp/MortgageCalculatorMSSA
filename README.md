# MortgageCalculatorMSSA
This console application will calculate a mortgage on a property based on inputs from the user.
One of the projects to demonstrate back-end skills, this calculator requires user input and performs equations in order to calculate the monthly payment
and overall cost of a mortgage. Additionally it will determine if the mortgage is outside of the monthly income that is input, and advise a user if the
payment is not financially responsible based on their current salary.
This was created as part of the Micosoft Software and Systems Academy and resulted in a badge demonstrating understanding of basic programming skills 
using C#.
